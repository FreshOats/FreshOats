- Water Quality: I Think I've Been Poisoned...
  - This application investigates chemical contaminants in California's drinking water, acquiring and cleaning data, then presenting findings using Tableau
  - This acquires data from csv form as well as pdf formats from different sources
  - It takes into consideration different measurement units, chemical naming conventions, and regulation differences between governmental sources
  - Presents the data regarding high contamination using Tableau to present maps and graphs, while filtering for the past 5 and 75 years

- NFL Injury Analytics
  - This application utilizes supervised and unsupervised machine learning, deep learning, and feature analysis to find patterns in NFL injuries
  - Random Forests provided a high-accuracy, high precision model on a very imbalanced dataset, whereas Neural Networks produced a high-accuracy, high-recall model 
  - Additional analytics demonstrated different correlations with injuries associated to lower-body injuries and concussions

- Credit_Risk_Analysis: Credit Risk Analysis with Supervised Machine Learning
  - This application utilizes Ensemble Learning and Logistic Regression to predict credit risk. 
  - Easy Ensemble AdaBoost outperformed the other models, including Random Forest, oversampling, and undersampling, yielding 93% accuracy

- Cryptocurrencies: Clustering Cryptocurrencies
  - Application of K-Means clustering to identify groups of crypotocurrencies in unsupervised learning
  - With PCA and clustering, the currencies were grouped into 4 different groups with one cryptocurrency standing out in a group of its own

- Amazon_Vine_Analysis: Analyzing Bias in Amazon Vine Reviews
  - Utilizing AWS to analyze big data to determine whether there is a bias toward paid or unpaid reviewers, in this case with Amazon's pet products   
  - These data did not support a bias between the paid and unpaid reviewers for pet products

- Movies-ETL: Extract, Transform, Load, Action! 
  - This application cleans data acquired from Wikipedia and Kaggle to create a clean dataset for a Hack-a-thon

**Fun fact since the last time I updated this:** <br>
An ingredient list for a murder-mystery dinner party?<br> 
Eggplant<br>Tomatoes<br>Potatoes<br>Cayenne Pepper<br>Goji Berries<br>Bell Peppers<br>Paprika<br>Tobacco<br>Deadly Nightshade aka Belladonna<br><br>

Perhaps. They are also all members of the nightshade family, sharing the characteristic that they all contain alakaloids. Peppers, tomatoes, eggplants, and goji berries are all nightshade fruits (they developed from a flower and contain seeds), while potatoes are a nightshade vegetable. Tomatoes contain more alkaloids in the vine and leaves than the fruit itself, which is why some people have a reaction when their skin makes contact with the vines. What makes Deadly Nightshade do deadly? It has a very high concentration of these alkaloids in all parts of the plant. The other members have a much lower concentration, making them not only safe, but in some cases even helpful.
