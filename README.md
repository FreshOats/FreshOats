- Cryptocurrencies: Clustering Cryptocurrencies
  - Application of K-Means clustering to identify groups of crypotocurrencies in unsupervised learning
  - With PCA and clustering, the currencies were grouped into 4 different groups with one cryptocurrency standing out in a group of its own

- Amazon_Vine_Analysis: Analyzing Bias in Amazon Vine Reviews
  - Utilizing AWS to analyze big data to determine whether there is a bias toward paid or unpaid reviewers, in this case with Amazon's pet products   
  - These data did not support a bias between the paid and unpaid reviewers for pet products

**Fun fact since the last time I updated this:** <br>
The last two months to be added to the Gregorian Calendar were January and February, so our months are now mostly named after Roman gods and bad mathematics. January (named after Janus) and February (from *februa* - cleansing) were basically a dead period so the Romans didn't start the calendar until March (named after Mars). April is thought to stem from the Latin *aperio* (to open) as a reference to opening of buds in the spring. The other months all used to be numbered, but were changed with the Julian calendar to include May (Maia), June (Juno), July (named after Julius Caesar), August (after Augustus Caesar), and then due to the 2 month shift, our 9th-12th months, September (7th), October (8th), November (9th) and December (10th). 

The Slavic Calendar names, still used in several countries including Ukraine, is still not outdated though it is older than the Julian/Gregorian calendar. Most of the names sound similar across the Slavic languages, but since I know the Ukrainian ones, I'll just include those: сiчень - the felling (possibly for cutting trees for firewood), лютий - a furious and cruel month, березень - birch (leaves start growing), квiтень - flowers (start blooming), травень - grass (is fully green), червень - red (like fruid, or from the insect черв used to produce red dye), липень - linden (blooms everywhere mid-summer), серпень - scythe/sickle (it's harvest time!), вересень - Heather (a lovely purple flower that blooms in autumn), жовтень - yellow (the turning of the leaves), листопад - falling leaves, грудень - lump (the hardening of soil as it freezes or small lumps of snow).
